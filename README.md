# Personal Projects

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my repo of personal projects! 

There are a quite a few projects that I've stored in here, and none are really that related to each other, but each hold a special place in my heart.

Please look around and mess with whatever you like to. Let me know if there are any issues or bugs.

## Project List

* AudioBalancer - All of my stuff for my version of the DEEJ audio balancer

* Cocotb - My experiments and learning with Cocotb, the python based FPGA verification toolset

* Fleet Run Configurations - Various run configs for JetBrain's Fleet IDE

* ESPHome - Custom smart home projects
